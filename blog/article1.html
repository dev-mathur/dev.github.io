            <p>Hello! Welcome to my Personal Blog! I know what you are thinking. Gosh, another blog. What is up with tech bros and their own personal blogs.
               I do not like to be like everybody else. Trust me. Other personal tech blogs only focus on the author's credentials, the projects that they're working 
               on, and their vast experiences within the field. And all of those are very useful information. I am not doubting that. But personally, I just need an outlet
               to talk about many things. It will most likely be tech related. But also my mental health, some things I find interesting, and also my experiences. Expect this
               to be as authentic as possible. If I gain an audience from this, great! If I can help at least one person learn something, then I have at least accomplished something
               in this world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now to the juicy stuff. I want to talk about a major mistake that I have made during my education that is affecting my ability to do what I was trained to do, which 
                is working in tech. And I have just realized this at the very end of my education. If I had realized this sooner, then I feel like my path would be much different than
                now. Just to give you some background, I have completed my undergrad in Applied Computer Science with a minor in 
                Business Management. The premise of this program essentially is to apply CS principles to another field, which in my case is Business. At the time I really did not know what
                I was doing so I picked this degree over the traditional Computer Science degree. I didn't miss much though. I completed the CS curriculum, I just missed one class which I really
                didn't want to take. I then decided to do a Master's degree at my university as the pandemic hit as soon as I graduated, and the job market really suffered. Also at that time 
                I was really into PM so I figured doing the master's degree was the way to go.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now let me tell you the major mistake. To say the least, I DID NOT DEEPLY LEARN AND UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. NOTHING! The knowledge that I have currently is all surface knowledge. I am
                not saying I cannot compute even the basics of functions, but my understanding of software is too surface level. After completing a Bachelor's in 3 years, and a Master's in 1 year, I am
                ashamed to say that I have wasted my time. And it is not the fault of anybody but myself. I went to a top school. A very top school in terms of Computer Science and Information Management.
                But I wasted all that time in classes, and missed so many opportunities. Now how did I know that I wasted these past 4 years? I will tell you about an interview I did with a startup. This was 
                a startup within the prestigious Y combinator. And the position was Founding Engineer. This means that I would architect the technical direction of their software platform, hire the engineering team, 
                and work with the CEO to the company's direction. It was an awesome role, with excellent pay. When I reached out to them and submitted my CV, they were very impressed. I mean given my credentials, I 
                would be the perfect fit for them. Right? Oh how wrong I was. How deeply wrong I was. Coming into the interview, I thought I knew everything that they were asking for. I mean I studied Computer Science
                at THE University of Washington right? But the interview went terrible. I mean terrible. They asked me the most basic questions. I first got asked about my understanding of Java. I mean I took 2 classes,
                did many projects, and my internship was in Java right? I couldn't tell them what the JVM was. How did JVM work. What is compiled vs. Interpreted. I took databases, and implemented a database for a few projects
                of mine right? I couldn't answer what the difference between NoSQL and SQL was. I did not understand methods to scale DBs. I did not understand what the difference between scaling vertically and horizontally meant.
                It was 45 minutes of hell. In 45 minutes I realized what a failure I was. I blew an opportunity to work in such a high position for my first job out of college. And worst of all, I felt like a fraud.

            <p>
                After doing some reflection, I realized what mistakes I have made to get to this part in my life, and what I need to do moving forward. Here are the mistakes that I have made that has made me 
                waste the past 4 years of my life:
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>I did not have a plan.</h3>
            <p>
                This was the stupidest thing to do. Not have any plan. Coming into college, I thought I will just breeze through classes, and then just have an internship each summer. What I did not realize was that internships 
                start opening the fall before summer. So it is beneficial to apply during the fall, hopefully get an interview, and then get the offer by December/January. That is usually how the timing works.
                I did not realize that. I would start applying during MARCH, when most/all positions have been filled. I also would apply to every application that I saw on linkedin, and other job postings. That is very counterproductive
                because your applications need to show why you are a good fit for the company, and the position, not just show your credentials and hope the company likes you. And lastly, I never networked. To be honest I used to be anxious 
                of talking to strangers and asking them for something, but had I done more networking, I definitely would have recieved interviews, and even offers at top companies for internships. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; color: white;">Here is how I would approach applying to internships if I time traveled back in time to my freshman year:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a spreadsheet of companies I would like to intern for, and what kind of positions.</li>
                <li>Go on Linkedin, connect with individuals who currently work at listed companies and reach out for coffee chats. Talk about their experience working for said company and said role. Keep updating them and build relationships.</li>
                <li>Reach out to those I have connected with in positions I am interested in and get referred into the process. Also have them prep my resume, and brush up on interview skills</li>
                <li>Study a crap load on CS fundamentals, DS&A, and go through the interview process</li>
                <li>Get the offers rolling in</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>I did not pay attention in class.</h3>
            <p>Again, stupid ass shit. I would literally be on my laptop in every class and just browse websites, and text my friends. Especially during those crucial courses (Data Structures and Algorithms, Databases, Hardware & OS,
                Software Engineering). This is why I messed up on those interviews. I did not pay attention in these crucial classes, resulting in me not deeply learning the essential topics. Remember kids, pay attention in class. This isn't 
                high school anymore.
            </p>
            <h3>I cared more about grades.</h3>
            <p>THIS. Like I said before, college is not high school. But I treated college like high school. If I am being honest, I was a bad student in high school. Graduated in the bottom 25% of my class with a 2.7 GPA cumulative. Wasn't really 
                involved with the student body. Screwed around. Followed people, especially girls. So coming into college, I wanted to have better grades. Yes I didn't pay attention in class, but I would study a lot, but only to memorize in order to ace
                these classes. This was an extremely bad approach. These topics are supposed to prepare you for your career. So do not take them lightly. Yes grades are important, but understanding these key concepts are much more important. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Wow! This was a lot to unpack. This definitely feels like therapy for me. To those reading this, please pay attention to my mistakes, and how to mitigate them. Especially you CS student. Do not screw around. Otherwise you will graduate college
                without feeling a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. Study hard, but for the right reasons. Party hard too, as long as you have studied hard. Take care - Dev
