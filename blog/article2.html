            <h1>My Roadmap moving forward.</h1>
            <p>October 16th, 2021</p>
            <!--First Paragraph-->
            <p>
               If you all are still with me after my very lengthy debut post, then kudos to you. It seems that you have taken an interest 
               in my twisted and confusing journey. I will say that this article will be much more compact than the last one. And frankly, it will 
               be much more useful to you all. Not just the CS students looking to nab that sweet internship, but frankly, anybody. Please realize that 
               any path that you take is a marathon, not a race. It has taken me YEARS to realize that. I would give up because I would not obtain instantaneous 
               results. But your ability to reach your goals will only be dependent on your grit, and determination.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!--Second Paragraph-->
            <p>
                Now after reading up on my mistakes in the past 4 years that resulted me in wasting my education, you all are probably wondering what I am going to do.
                I need a job fast. I will be set to graduate in December. That is not a lot of time. So here is what I am going to do. I will be restarting my tech journey.
                Yes, you heard that right. Back to zero. All the way back to the basics. You are probably thinking that I am crazy, and that I do not need to go all the way back.
                But you need to understand that my knowledge is the equivalent of a puddle. I need to get it to the Pacific Ocean. And how will that work? By re-establishing my fundamental
                understanding of technology and building on top of it.
            </p>
            <!--Roadmap-->
            <p>
                Here is the roadmap I am following to re-establish my understanding of technology. <a style="color: lightblue;" href="https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/TechTopics/CodingRoadmap2020/learn_coding_roadmap_2020.md">I am following this amazing article by
                CodeBasics. Please Give him a follow.</a> However, I am making some key adjustments.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!--First Module-->
            <h3>Computer Science Extreme Basics.</h3>
            <p>
                Square One. That is what I am going back towards. Gosh I feel like a 14 year old again, taking my very first programming class. But yes, I will be going all the way back to how a computer works.
                Do you know that I do not even know how to convert numbers to binary? Its very embarrasing. So this will be my first foundational building block. Here are the steps I am taking to complete this 
                module.
            </p>
            <ul class="customList">
                <li>Digital Information Storage - How does a computer store information, binary calculations</li>
                <li>How the internet Works - HTTP protocols, sending requests, what is returned from those requests</li>
                <li>What is Programming? - Definition of programming, and components of a computer program</li>
                <li>Basics of Algorithms - What is an algorithm, why is efficiency important</li>
                <li>Object Oriented - Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Polymorphism</li>
            </ul>
            <!--Second Module-->
            <h3>Front End Development</h3>
            <p>
                Still in basics. I feel like once I understand standard computer functionality, I can start some basic development. Which in this case is the standard HTML & CSS.
                I have purchased 2 online courses in the past that I will review. But instead of skipping around, I will actually digest all the information, and do as many projects I can.
            </p>
            <!--Third Module-->
            <h3>High Level Programming Language</h3>
            <p>
               This will get a bit more challenging. But I will thoroughly learn, and apply one high level programming language. I was 50/50 on javascript or python, but given how versatile it is, and the number of jobs
               in full stack development in this language, I think I will stick with Javascript.
            </p>
            <!--Fourth Module-->
            <h3>Data Structures</h3>
            <p>
               After being proficient in the high level programming language, I will familiarize myself with every data structure that can be used. Even though I did say I will stick with Javascript for my high level language,
               I think I will implement using Python. I am still not sure though. But here is the list of Data Structures I will familiarize myself with.
            </p>
            <ul class="customList">
                <li>Array</li>
                <li>Stacks</li>
                <li>Queues</li>
                <li>Linked List</li>
                <li>Hashmap</li>
                <li>Trees</li>
            </ul>
            <!--Fifth Module-->
            <h3>Databases</h3>
            <p>
               Again, I will re-evaluate my SQL skills as I have experience. But I will thoroughly go through every concept, as well as methods to scale databases. I will also go over NoSQL databases and the essential differences
               between SQL and NoSQL.
            </p>
            <!--Sixth Module-->
            <h3>Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
               Finally, I will dive deep into algorithms. I will cover every common algorithm used in interviews, and learn how to implement them. I have done a few DS&A interviews and failed every single one of them. I do not want this to 
               keep recurring. I want to thoroghly understand the importance of every algorithm, and be able to calculate the space and time complexity. Here is the list of Algorithms I will cover.
            </p>
            <ul class="customList">
                <li>Algorithm Analysis - Space and Time Complexity</li>
                <li>Binary Search</li>
                <li>Sorting - Bubble, Quick, Insertion, Merge, Selection, Shell</li>
                <li>Recursion</li>
                <li>Linked List algorithms</li>
                <li>Tree Traversal - BFS, DFS, Preorder, Postorder, Inorder</li>
                <li>Dijiktra's Algorithm</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now you are wondering, Dev if you are going to learn all of this, how long will it take you? Well to be honest, I have 2 months until I graduate. So that is my goal. Be proficient in full stack development
                before January 2022. In order to get to this goal, I have to actively study 4-6 hours every single day. But I will not rush. I am currently reading a book called UltraLearning. I will discuss the exact premise
                of the book in a future post. In the meantime, I have created a google sheet to track my progress. Keep in mind I have tracked progress effectively before with this sheet. I have perfected it to my needs.

            <p>Here is the spreadsheet I am using to track my progress. This will be updated frequently. I will make sure to post as many updates as I can on here. - Dev</p>
