        <h1>Hi. My name is Dev</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I'm a Software Engineering & Business Management student currently living in Seattle, Washington. I spend my time learning about anything and everything. Whether it is about new products launching in the market day by day, upcoming technologies that are being utilized by many developers, or even wine, I like to learn more about them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the moment, I have been exploring the Javascript stack a lot. Utilizing ReactJS to build beautiful front end components, writing a backend infrastructure in Nodejs, while communicating with a mongoDB database is very fun to do. I have also been learning more about API development in REST, and eventually want to learn about GraphQL.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I do like to build great teams, and build new products. Currently working on one called Amido. More on that coming up soon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My goal is eventually either start my own company that will build products to fill great gaps in today's market, or work in a Product role for an organization that I believe in.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Check out my projects below. This will be a growing list.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Here is the link to my previous website if you wanna take a look</p>
