    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, divided</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons Thai yellow curry paste (such as Mae PloyÂ®)</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cubed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 4 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook curry paste until fragrant and starting to break up, about 3 minutes. Add tofu and onion. Stir to coat with curry paste and cook until tofu releases its moisture and starts to look drier, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in soy sauce and vinegar. Stir in garlic, zucchini, and broccoli.</li>
        <li>Mix everything in the saucepan well and cook until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. If vegetables are not releasing enough moisture, add a splash of vegetable stock to prevent sticking too much; keep the heat medium to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Once everything is yellow-tinged from the paste and your kitchen smells amazing, the vegetables should be looking brighter but not overcooked, and the pot should be making a high sizzling sound. Pour in vegetable stock and coconut cream. Mix, scraping the bottom to bring up any flavor bits, and lower heat. Only cover the saucepan if the amount of liquid looks very little compared to vegetables and tofu. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, checking every few minutes because it shouldn't take long from this point to warm through and meld flavors.</li>
    </ol>
