	<h2>This Is My Capstone Draft</h2>

	<p class="quote">
	I plan to make my capstone assignment a portfolio of the projects I have completed in this course as well as in my freetime. 
	</p>

	<p>I am known to be somewhat of a visual person, a designer in some sense. But in terms of my career, I want to get into software development or product management. I want to use my professional skills to develop practicial solutions to complex issues.</p>

	<p>When users go on my website, I want them to take away that although I am intending to go into the software development field, I am known to be a creative person.</p>

	<p>My three strongest skills are project management, software development, and visual design. I have started out as a visual designer, but I have slowly moved over to software development and web design.</p>
	
	<p>As inspiration, I take a look at other people's projects and portfolio. I inspect the purpose of their projects and how they percieve themselves to create solutions.</p>
